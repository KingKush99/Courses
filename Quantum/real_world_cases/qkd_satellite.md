# Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) â€” LEO to Ground

**Pattern:** Satellite relays distribute symmetric keys to ground stations using quantum states (BB84/decoy-state).  
**Value:** Forward secrecy and eavesdropper detection.  
**Risks:** Weather/attenuation, side-channels, and operational scalability.  
**KPI ideas:** Secret key rate (bps), QBER, uptime %, cost/key.
