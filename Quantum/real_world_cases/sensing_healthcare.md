# Quantum Sensing in Healthcare

**Pattern:** Cold-atom or NV-diamond sensors detect subtle signals (e.g., cardiac, neural, or hematologic markers).  
**Value:** Earlier detection, non-invasive triage, and portable diagnostics.  
**Risks:** Calibration drift, clinical validation, data governance.  
**KPI ideas:** Sensitivity/specificity, time-to-diagnosis, total cost of care.
