Drop-in fix for overlapping UI and corner panels.

Files:
- assets/base.css
- assets/app.js

How to use:
1) Replace these two files in your repo.
2) Wrap your page content with <main class="wrap"> ... </main> to keep it away from fixed corners.
3) The four corner buttons + panels are injected automatically by app.js on every page.
